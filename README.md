# RayTracing

## Ideas to implement:
- Cohen-Sutherland algorithm for AABB intersection speedup
- Mesh generation from .OBJ files
- Ingo Wald's papers like [fast, dynamic bvh's](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~boulos/papers/togbvh.pdf) 
- Optimizing bvh tree generation
- Implementing a good metric collecting system or more like learn to use `gprof`
